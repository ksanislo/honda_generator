Honda EU2200i Generator integration for Home Assistant

This doesn't actually work as an integration, as I haven't had time to get back to finishing things.

However the tools/honda_power.py script already demonstrates basic functionality in communicating with the generator from the CLI, and may be helpful as a starting point for someone else trying to do similar things. I will hopefully be able to get back to this project and build a working HA integration later on this year.
